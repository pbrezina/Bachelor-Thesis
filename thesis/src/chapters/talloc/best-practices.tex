\section{Best practices}
\label{talloc:sec:best-practices}

The following sections contain several best practices and good manners that were
found by the Samba and SSSD developers over the years. These will help you to
write better code, easier to debug and with as few (hopefully none) memory
leaks as possible.

\subsection{Keep the context hierarchy steady}

The talloc is a hierarchy memory allocator. The hierarchy nature is what makes
the programming more error proof. It makes the memory easier to manage and
to free. Therefore, the first thing we should have on our mind is: always
project our data structures into the talloc context hierarchy.

\noindent
That means if we have a structure, we should always use it as a parent context
for its elements. This way we will not encounter any troubles when freeing this
structure or when changing its parent. The same rule applies for arrays.

For example, the structure |user| which is defined in the Listing
\ref{struct-user} (page \pageref{struct-user}) should be created with the
context hierarchy illustrated on Figure \ref{fig:bp-context-tree}.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \input{./figures/talloc/context-tree-bp}
  \caption{Context tree of struct user}
  \label{fig:bp-context-tree}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Every function should use its own context}
\label{talloc:subsec:function-use-own-context}

It is a good practice to create a temporary talloc context at the function
beginning and free this context just before the return statement. All the data
must be allocated on this context or on its children. This ensures that no
memory leaks are created as long as we do not forget to free the temporary
context.

This pattern applies to both situations - when a function does not return any
dynamically allocated value and when it does. However, it needs a little
extension for the latter case.

\subsubsection{Functions that do not return any dynamically allocated value}

If the function does not return any value created on the heap, we will just obey
the aforementioned pattern.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Temporary context \#1},label=lst:tmp-ctx-1]
int bar()
{
  int ret;
  TALLOC_CTX *tmp_ctx = talloc_new(NULL);
  if (tmp_ctx == NULL) {
    ret = ENOMEM;
    goto done;
  }
  /* allocate data on tmp_ctx or on its descendants */
  ret = EOK;
done:
  talloc_free(tmp_ctx);
  return ret;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Functions returning dynamically allocated values}

If our function returns any dynamically allocated data, its first parameter
should always be the destination talloc context. This context serves as a parent
for the output values. But again, we will create the output values as the
descendants of the temporary context. If everything goes well, we will change
the parent of the output values from the temporary to the destination talloc
context.

This pattern ensures that if an error occurs (e.g. I/O error or insufficient
amount of the memory), all allocated data is freed and no garbage appears on
the destination context.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Temporary context \#2},label=lst:tmp-ctx-2]
int struct_foo_init(TALLOC_CTX *mem_ctx, struct foo **_foo)
{
  int ret;
  struct foo *foo = NULL;
  TALLOC_CTX *tmp_ctx = talloc_new(NULL);
  if (tmp_ctx == NULL) {
    ret = ENOMEM;
    goto done;
  }
  foo = talloc_zero(tmp_ctx, struct foo);
  /* ... */
  *_foo = talloc_steal(mem_ctx, foo);
  ret = EOK;
done:
  talloc_free(tmp_ctx);
  return ret;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Allocate temporary contexts on NULL}
\label{talloc:subsec:tmp-ctx-on-null}

As it can be seen on the Listing \ref{lst:tmp-ctx-2}, instead of allocating the
temporary context directly on |mem_ctx|, we created a new top level context
using |NULL| as the parameter for |talloc_new()| function. Take a look at the
following example:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Temporary context \#3},label=lst:tmp-ctx-3]
char * create_user_filter(TALLOC_CTX *mem_ctx,
                          uid_t uid, const char *username)
{
  char *filter = NULL;
  char *sanitized_username = NULL;
  /* tmp_ctx is a child of mem_ctx */
  TALLOC_CTX *tmp_ctx = talloc_new(mem_ctx);
  if (tmp_ctx == NULL) {
    return NULL;
  }
  
  sanitized_username = sanitize_string(tmp_ctx, username);
  if (sanitized_username == NULL) {
    talloc_free(tmp_ctx);
    return NULL;
  }
  
  filter = talloc_aprintf(tmp_ctx,"(|(uid=%llu)(uname=%s))",
                          uid, sanitized_username);
  if (filter == NULL) {
    return NULL; /* tmp_ctx is not freed */ (*@\label{lst:tmp-ctx-3:leak}@*)
  }
  
  /* filter becomes a child of mem_ctx */
  filter = talloc_steal(mem_ctx, filter);
  talloc_free(tmp_ctx);
  return filter;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
We forgot to free |tmp_ctx| before the |return| statement on line
\ref{lst:tmp-ctx-3:leak}. However, it is created as a child of |mem_ctx| context
and as such it will be freed as soon as the |mem_ctx| is freed. Therefore, no
detectable memory leak is created.

On the other hand, we do not have any way to access the allocated data
and for all we know |mem_ctx| may exist for the lifetime of our application.
For these reasons this should be considered as a memory leak. How can we detect
if it is unreferenced but still attached to its parent context? The only way
is to notice the mistake in the source code.

But if we create the temporary context as a top level context, it will not be
freed and memory diagnostic tools
(e.g. |valgrind|\footnote{\url{http://valgrind.org}}) are able to do their job.

\subsection{Temporary contexts and the talloc pool}
\label{talloc:subsec:tmp-ctx-and-pool}

If we want to take the advantage of the talloc pool but also keep to the
pattern introduced in the previous section, we are unable to do it directly. The
best thing to do is to create a conditional build where we can decide how do we
want to create the temporary context. For example, we can create the following
macros:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Conditional temporary context
macros},label=lst:tmp-ctx-4]
#ifdef USE_POOL_CONTEXT
  #define CREATE_POOL_CTX(ctx, size) talloc_pool(ctx, size)
  #define CREATE_TMP_CTX(ctx)        talloc_new(ctx)
#else
  #define CREATE_POOL_CTX(ctx, size) talloc_new(ctx)
  #define CREATE_TMP_CTX(ctx)        talloc_new(NULL)
#endif
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
Now if our application is under development, we will build it with macro
|USE_POOL_CONTEXT| undefined. This way, we  can use memory diagnostic
utilities to detect memory leaks.

The release version will be compiled with the macro defined. This will  enable
pool contexts and therefore reduce the |malloc()| calls, which will end up in a
little bit faster processing.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Conditional temporary context},label=lst:tmp-ctx-5]
int struct_foo_init(TALLOC_CTX *mem_ctx, struct foo **_foo)
{
  int ret;
  struct foo *foo = NULL;
  TALLOC_CTX *tmp_ctx = CREATE_TMP_CTX(mem_ctx);
  /* ... */
}

errno_t handle_request(TALLOC_CTX mem_ctx)
{
  int ret;
  struct foo *foo = NULL;
  TALLOC_CTX *pool_ctx = CREATE_POOL_CTX(NULL, 1024);
  ret = struct_foo_init(mem_ctx, &foo);
  /* ... */
}
\end{lstlisting}
