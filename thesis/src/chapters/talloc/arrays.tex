\section{Arrays and talloc}
\label{talloc:sec:arrays}

\subsection{Creating a new array}

We are already able to create an array with the knowledge introduced in
previous text. We can do it in the same way as in the C standard library using
|talloc_size()| where the size of the context would be |sizeof(type) *|
|number_of_elements|.

However this has two disadvantages. First of all we have to use the type unsafe
functions to allocate the requested size which is just wrong. And at second,
we have to do the multiplication by ourselves. Talloc developers were aware of
it and they created a separate interface for arrays:

\begin{funcproto}
(#type)* talloc_array(TALLOC_CTX *ctx, #type,
                      unsigned int count)
(#type)* talloc_zero_array(TALLOC_CTX *ctx, #type
                           unsigned int count)
void* talloc_array_size(TALLOC_CTX *ctx, size_t size,
                        unsigned int count)
void* talloc_array_ptrtype(TALLOC_CTX *ctx, #ptrtype,
                           unsigned int count)
\end{funcproto}
\funclistend
Or to reallocate the array use:

\begin{funcproto}
void* talloc_realloc(TALLOC_CTX *parent,
                     TALLOC_CTX *ctx,
                     #type, size_t count)
void* talloc_realloc_size(TALLOC_CTX *parent,
                          TALLOC_CTX *ctx,
                          size_t size)
\end{funcproto}
\begin{funcdesc}
If |ctx| is |NULL| new context is created. If |count| or |size| is zero, it will
free the context. The memory occupied by |ctx| may be moved to other location,
therefore always replace it by the returned pointer.
\end{funcdesc}
\funclistend
We should always project the natural structure of an array into talloc context
hierarchy. That is, always use the array as a parent of its dynamically created
elements.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Array of users and context hierarchy},
label={array-users}] int i, j;
struct user **users;
users = talloc_zero_array(NULL, struct user*, N + 1);

for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  users[i] = talloc_zero(users, struct user);
  users[i]->num_groups = i;
  users[i]->groups = talloc_zero_array(users[i], char*, i);
  
  for (j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    users[i]->groups[j] = talloc_asprintf(
                          users[i]->groups[j],"Group %d",j);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

This way we gain a lot of flexibility. We do not have to free every element
separately to deallocate the whole array, we can achieve this simply by calling
|talloc_free(users)|. Or we can move any part of the array to another parent
context to keep it accessible even if we free the array later.

The context tree that graphically illustrates the hierarchy from previous
listing can be find on Figure \ref{fig:context-tree-users}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Determining length of an array}

We can find ourselves in situation when we need to iterate through an array but
we are not able to use a special delimiter to mark the end of the array. We need
to have the knowledge of the size of this array stored in other variable.

Every talloc context carries its size in bytes with it, this gives us the means
to determine the length of the array at any time. Therefore we do not have to
carry the number of the elements separately. Talloc has defined a macro
|talloc_array_length(ctx)| for this purpose.

It can be also used as a more efficient way of computing a number of characters
in a string that has been created with talloc library.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Length of an array},label=lst:array-length]
TALLOC_CTX *ctx = talloc_new(NULL);
int *i = talloc_zero(ctx, int);
char *str = talloc_strdup(ctx, "hello world");
int *array = talloc_array(ctx, int, 10);

printf("%lu\n", talloc_array_length(ctx));   /*  0 */
printf("%lu\n", talloc_array_length(i));     /*  1 */
printf("%lu\n", talloc_array_length(str));   /* 12 */
printf("%lu\n", talloc_array_length(array)); /* 10 */

talloc_free(ctx);
\end{lstlisting}
