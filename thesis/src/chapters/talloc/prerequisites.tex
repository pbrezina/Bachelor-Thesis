\section{Prerequisites}
\label{talloc:prerequisites}

This thesis uses talloc version 2.0.6 as a reference.

The current version of the talloc library can be obtained from the project
homepage:
{\footnotesize\url{http://talloc.samba.org}}.

It is also available in the Fedora and Ubuntu distribution repositories and
can be installed on those systems using:

\begin{commandline}
# on Fedora
yum install libtalloc libtalloc-devel

# on Ubuntu
apt-get install libtalloc2 libtalloc-dev
\end{commandline}
\funclistend
Each example in this chapter expects that the |talloc.h| header file is included
and the |talloc| library is properly linked against the binary.

Further, the error checking code is included only for a case, when a new
function is introduced in order to make the examples simpler and shorter. The
full version of the examples with the error checks can be found on the attached
DVD medium.
