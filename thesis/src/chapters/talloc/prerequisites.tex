\label{talloc:prerequisites}

This thesis uses as a reference talloc version 2.0.6.

The current version of talloc library can be obtained from a homepage of the
project: {\footnotesize\url{http://talloc.samba.org}}.

It is also available in Fedora and Ubuntu repositories a therefore it can be
installed on those systems using:

\begin{commandline}
# on Fedora
yum install libtalloc libtalloc-devel

# on Ubuntu
apt-get install libtalloc2 libtalloc-dev
\end{commandline}
\funclistend
Each example in this chapter expects that |talloc.h| header file is included and
|talloc| library is properly linked to the assembly.
