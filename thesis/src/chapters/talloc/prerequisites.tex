\section{Prerequisites}
\label{talloc:prerequisites}

This thesis uses talloc version 2.0.6 as a reference.

The current version of talloc library can be obtained from the project homepage:
{\footnotesize\url{http://talloc.samba.org}}.

It is also available in Fedora and Ubuntu repositories a therefore it can be
installed on those systems using:

\begin{commandline}
# on Fedora
yum install libtalloc libtalloc-devel

# on Ubuntu
apt-get install libtalloc2 libtalloc-dev
\end{commandline}
\funclistend
Each example in this chapter expects that |talloc.h| header file is included and
|talloc| library is properly linked to the assembly.

Also I decided to include the error checking code only when a new function is
introduced to make the examples simpler and shorter. The full version of the
examples with the error checks can be found on the attached DVD medium.
