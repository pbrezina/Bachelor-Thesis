Talloc is a hierarchical, reference counted memory pool system with destructors.
It is built atop the standard C library and it defines a set of utility
functions that altogether simplifies allocation and deallocation of data,
especially large structures that contains many dynamically allocated elements
such as strings and arrays.

The main purpose of this library is to lower the possibility of creating
memory leaks in long running applications. This is achieved by a hierarchical
structure of talloc contexts where deallocating one context will end up
freeing all its descendants as well.

\subsubsection{Main features}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Open source project
  \item Hierarchical memory model
  \item Natural projection of data structures into the memory
  \item Simplifies memory management of large data structures
  \item Automatic execution of a destructor before the memory is freed
  \item Simulates dynamic type system
  \item Transparent memory pool
